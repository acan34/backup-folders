## PowerShell Backup Script 
This is a simple PowerShell script that allow you to backup files from one folder to another.

The source and destination paths have to be manually changed in the script but that's really the only thing to do.

### Disclaimer
This is the first time I used PowerShell therefore it might not be the most efficient way to use it for backups yet it's the one I use. Feel free to make it more efficient.

 ### Additional notes 
 If you wish the script to be launched via a batch file, you may do it like so : 
 >PowerShell C:\PathToWhereTheScriptIs\NameOfTheScript.ps1 

If you wish to automate it, you may check the Task Scheduler. Here is one way to open it :
>1. WIN + R
>2. taskschd.msc
>3. Hit enter

### Enjoy !
